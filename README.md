Investors and financial analysts continually seek cutting-edge tools to predict stock market trends with high accuracy. This endeavor not only boosts investment returns but also mitigates financial risks. In the realm of stock price prediction, the advent of deep learning technologies has marked a revolutionary leap. Among these technologies, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models stand out due to their ability to remember long-term dependencies, a crucial factor in the volatile domain of stock prices.

LSTM models have carved a niche for themselves, demonstrating robustness in handling time-series data like stock prices, which are influenced by a multitude of factors including past performance and current events. By learning from the sequence of data points without losing the ‘memory’ of earlier inputs, LSTMs offer a profound advantage in predictive accuracy over traditional models.

To fuel these sophisticated models, high-quality, real-time data is paramount. Here, we are going to use EODHD, a real-time price data provider with a solid reputation among data providers in this market. Its real-time API provides US Stock Market price feeds with an impressive 50ms delay.

Throughout this article, we will explore the integration of LSTM with the robust data retrieval capabilities of the EODHD API. We’ll cover the essential processes of fetching and preparing data, feature engineering, normalizing inputs, and constructing a predictive model to forecast stock prices. By the end, you’ll gain insights into harnessing these advanced tools in your financial analyses, potentially transforming your approach to market predictions.
